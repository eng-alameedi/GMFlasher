# System Design

The system design phase is a crucial and complex part of the overall process. The design must encompass the application's modules responsible for functionality, the user interface, communication with the microcontroller, data flow, data storage, and safety considerations.

1. __Architecture Design:__ The system is divided into the following sub-modules:

    - Validate .hex File: Ensure the file exists and can be opened.
    - Parse Data: Convert data from the Intel HEX format to the ATmega328p page format (128 bytes).
    - Generate Output: Create the output file (json file).
    - File Management: Properly close both the read and write files after processing.

2. __User Interface Design:__ The command-line interface (CLI) will handle essential tasks, including:

    - System Interaction: Utilize NCURSES for enhanced system interaction and terminal control.
    - User Input Validation: Validate the syntax and correctness of user-entered commands.
    - Visualize Output: Provide a clear visualization of the output and the process state to keep the user informed.
    - Help and Documentation: Provide comprehensive support through integrated help and documentation features.

3. __Microcontroller Communication:__ To establish communication with the ATmega328p, the following steps are performed:

    - Verify System Port: Ensure the UART port is available and operational.
    - Send Hello Acknowledgment: Transmit a "hello" acknowledgment to the device.
    - Validate UART on Device: Confirm that the UART interface on the device is functioning correctly.
    - Receive Welcome Acknowledgment: Await and process a "welcome" acknowledgment from the device.

4. __Data Follow (processing):__ Ensure seamless data flow and integrity with the device through the following operations:

    - Read: send (r) Retrieve data from the device's flash memory.
    - Write: send (w) Write the user-provided file to the device's flash memory.
    - Fuses: send (f) Read the status of the device's programming fuses.

5. __Data Security:__ Verify data security by implementing a checksum process to validate both input and output data.

6. __Error Handling:__ Implement a comprehensive error-handling mechanism for the application, covering the following aspects:

    - System Checks: Verify the system's readiness and environment setup.
    - Input Validation: Ensure user inputs meet the required format and criteria.
    - File Integrity: Confirm the existence, accessibility, and validity of files.
    - Data Parsing: Detect and handle errors during data conversion or parsing.
    - Communication Verification: Monitor and validate the communication with the device.
    - Data Flow Monitoring: Ensure data transmission and processing integrity.
    - Abnormal Behavior Detection: Identify and respond to unexpected application behavior.
    - Resource Cleanup: Safely close files and terminate connections to prevent resource leaks.
