# Requirement Analysis

     Analyzing application requirements is a critical step in the design process. It involves identifying the purpose of the application, gathering relevant information, and engaging with users to understand specific features. The requirements analysis process may include, but is not limited to, the following guidelines:

1. __Purpose:__
   The primary goal of this app is to ***facilitate interaction with the ATmega328p microcontroller***. It enables users to read from and write to the flash and EEPROM memory, as well as manage the microcontroller's fuses. This includes both retrieving the current fuse settings and configuring new ones.

2. __Requirement:__
   The application requirements can be classified into:

      - Functional Requirements:
         - Reading from and writing to ***flash and eeprom*** memory.
         - Initially, this application will support the ***ATmega328p*** microcontroller, with plans to add compatibility for other controllers in the future.
         - This application will prioritize ***UART*** communication over other protocols.
         - This application will operate within a command-line environment, utilizing the ***NCURSES*** library.
         - This application will implement a robust error-checking mechanism based on ***data checksums***.

      - Non-Functional Requirements:
         - This application is designed to run on Linux and macOS, with future support planned for Windows.

3. __Stakeholder Identification:__
      - This application is aimed at developer users and focuses on enhancing the overall process based on user feedback.
